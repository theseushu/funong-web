see config.js

        'react-redux-toastr',
        'react-icons',
        'react-jss',
        'react-photoswipe',
        'disposables',
        'react-mdl',
        'react-mdl-extra',

those libs are supposed to be used in es6

I haven't figured out how to configure them yet
So they are excluded for now until I get some time to deal with it

Codes in app/ are importing them like {import from 'react-redux-toastr/lib/xxx'}. es5 code.
